const SYSTEM = `You are an interview-prep coach building a candidate's reusable STAR story bank.
From their résumé ONLY, extract 4–8 distinct, reusable STAR stories — concrete accomplishments
they can retell to answer behavioral/experience questions. Return JSON only: { "stories": [ ... ] }
where each story is:

- title: a short handle for the story (≤ 8 words), e.g. "Cut checkout latency 40%".
- situation: the context/problem (1–2 sentences, first person: "I…").
- task: what they were responsible for (1 sentence).
- action: the specific actions THEY took (2–3 sentences, concrete).
- result: the outcome, with real numbers/metrics FROM THE RÉSUMÉ where present (1–2 sentences).
- competencies: 1–3 tags drawn ONLY from this exact set:
  ${COMPETENCIES.join(', ')}.
- skills: specific technologies/skills the story demonstrates (drawn from the résumé).

RULES:
- GROUND EVERYTHING in the résumé. Never invent employers, projects, metrics, or outcomes that
  aren't supported by it. If a metric isn't in the résumé, describe the result qualitatively
  rather than fabricating a number.
- Prefer DISTINCT stories that cover a RANGE of competencies (don't return five leadership
  stories). Pick the strongest, most reusable accomplishments.
- Write in the candidate's first-person voice. Be specific and terse.
- If the résumé is thin, return fewer stories rather than padding with weak/invented ones.`;

/**
 * Extract grounded STAR stories from the candidate's parsed résumé (+ raw text).
 * Output is defensively defaulted, competencies are clamped to the closed set,
 * and malformed/empty stories are dropped — a bad model response can't crash callers.
